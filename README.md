> This is a work in progress. For me 0.x means I have the liberty of changing anything at anytime. Features may not work as advertised at all.
> **You may hit bugs that result in data loss.**
> This project _does_ function and I think it's worth your time to play with but just understand breaking changes and bugs will be a reality.
